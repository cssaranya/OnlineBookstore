KATA - DISTRIBUTED DEVELOPER -  Online Bookstore
This is a simple code kata that involves creating a basic front-end in React and a back-end using a RESTful API. We will create a Simple Online Bookstore. We will display a list of books and users will have the possibility to add books to their cart, display the cart and modify the quantity of items and remove items from the cart. 

The system will consist of a React front-end for the user interface and a Node.js/Express back-end for handling API requests. Do the development as you would do it when working in a real team.

Take TDD (Test Driven Development) into consideration.

Requirements:

Backend (Spring Boot):
              1.   Create a RESTful API using Spring Boot to handle book-related operations.
              2.   Implement endpoints for retrieving the list of available books.
              3.   Store book data in a database (e.g., H2 or MySQL).
              4.   Create endpoints for managing the shopping cart and processing orders.
              5.   Handle basic user authentication (login and registration).

General Instructions:
     1. Front-end and back-end should be in separate folders or repositories.
     2. Ensure that the front-end can make API requests to the back-end.
     3. Implement error handling and validation on both the front-end and back-end.
     4. Use appropriate HTTP status codes for API responses (e.g., 200, 201, 400, 404).
     5. Foresee a README file in the repo with the steps that we have to do to make the application runnable
